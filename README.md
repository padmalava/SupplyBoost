# SupplyBoost
![Banner](resource/banner.jpg)
SupplyBoost is a supply chain management application.
As an aspiring software developer, I'm always reading about new technologies and architectures - microservices, event streaming, crazy cloud stuff. It gets my nerd juices flowing!

But when it comes time to build something in the real-world, I struggle to put all these concepts together. Most projects are too small and I end up hacking things the old-fashioned way.

I know many of you face the same dilemma - you kinda know this tech but haven't really built anything meaningful with it.

So I started SupplyBoost to fix that! It's an ambitious supply chain app that lets me throw every book I've read at it! Microservices, check! Serverless, check! It's a cool playground to go wild!

No more toy apps and todo lists. This is the real deal - a complex beast that helps me level up my skills as an architect and developer. Sure I'll make ton of mistakes on the way, but that's how we learn ðŸ’ª

In the process, I hope to turn all these buzzwords into practical skills that can be applied to big real-world projects. No more hacky duct tape code!

So come join me on this journey! It's gonna be challenging but oh so rewarding. Let's turn theory into practice. Who's with me? ðŸš€
